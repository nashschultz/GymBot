# GymBot

This was a small project that I made in an hour or two. Ever since the onset of COVID-19, reservations are required for time slots at the gym (as they should be to promote safety and social distancing). However, I always forgot to book a time slot.

I created a small website with a calendar that allows you to pick the time slots. Then, I created a small python bot to read the data and then book the slot that you want. It has been immensely helpful and allows me to go to the gym everyday without a thought in my mind that I wouldn't get the slot.
